# Movie Genre Classifier

This project is a simple machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary using TF-IDF and a Naive Bayes classifier.

## Files
- `movie_genre_classifier.py`: Main Python script for training and predicting genres.
- `movies.csv`: Sample dataset with movie plots and genres.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python movie_genre_classifier.py
   ```

## Output
- Model accuracy and classification report
- Example genre prediction for a sample plot

## Notes
- You can expand `movies.csv` with more data for better results.
